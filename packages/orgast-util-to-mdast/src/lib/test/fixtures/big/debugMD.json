We will now only change one of these variables gradually, your position. You start to bravely swim along this meridian, eventually reaching the equator.

Meaning that once you reach the equator, instead of turning 90 degrees to face East, you shuffle Eastword across Africa like some sort of stray crab.

But now we have to revisit our original argument of why the resistivities take the specific quantised values (2.3). These were computed assuming that all states in the Landau level contribute to the current. Now we know that many of these states are localised by impurities and don’t transport charge. Surely we expect the value of the resistivity to be different. Right? Well, no. Remarkably, current carried by the extended states increases to compensate for the lack of current transported by localised states. This ensures that the resistivity remains quantised as (2.3) despite the presence of disorder=. -->"
